# Meeting Notes

<details>
<summary>2022-12-24</summary>

- Resumed work on pagination, which is causing performance issues.
- Started improving the treatment of client JavaScript.
  - `defer`.
  - Reuse functions (like we already do for CSS).
  - `morph` tooltips (which improves things on Live-Updates).

</details>

<details>
<summary>2022-12-17</summary>

- Introduced WebP for better performance & support for videos and animated GIFs.
- Converted the ‚ÄúActions‚Äù menu to be lazy-loaded, improving the performance significantly.
- Highest priority: Feature-parity with other platforms.
- Are replies to announcements sending notifications to everyone? (Later: No, they aren‚Äôt.)
- We considered an option on follow-ups to announcements that would allow a staff member to force sending notifications to everyone, similar to the announcement itself. Ultimately, we decided against it, because the benefit didn‚Äôt seem to compensate the complication in the system. For the time being, you can `@everyone`, since most people don‚Äôt change the default settings and receive notifications for `@mentions`.
- We may hire an intern for the summer.
- Autocomplete for `@everyone`, `@students`, and `@staff` (just focus on the right option as the person is typing).
- `@mentions` and `#references` widgets should disappear on `‚ê£`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2022-12-12</summary>

- Reuse conversations across semesters.
- Performance improvements of almost 2x by lazy loading dropdown menu for ‚ÄúActions‚Äù.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-12-03</summary>

- Progress:
  - Performance improvements of 2x.
  - Monitor.
  - Reusable messages across courses is almost finished.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-11-19</summary>

- Finished and deployed version 6.0.0 with new infrastructure.
- Prioritize being able to migrate content from Piazza and across semesters.
- Buy keywords in AdSense.
- At some point look for people who can do more proper marketing & sales.
- At some point look for people who can manage contracts & payments.
- Future pricing:
  - Free period and/or free tier.
  - Based on number of (active) classes.
  - Based on number of users.
- Table of comparison with other services, for example, Piazza and Ed.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-11-12</summary>

- Rearchitecture of processes, Live-Connections & Live-Updates, and so forth.
- Priorities moving forward:
  - Sidebar reorganization: Don‚Äôt change the user interface too much, given it‚Äôs almost the end of the semester and people are used to it.
  - Basic help for formatting, for example, the use of code fences (```).
  - Analytics, for example, the average time to respond, number of questions asked, and so forth.
  - Whispers.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-10-08</summary>

- Fixed an issue that was causing non-high-DPI images to be resized.
- Fixed an issue that was causing Firefox to show ‚ÄúFailed to connect to the Courselore server.‚Äù for a moment during reload.
- Started module bundling.
- We should start reaching out to more people on the spring, and before that we need:
  - Feature parity with Piazza.
  - Mobile application.
  - More robust notification system.
  - Better chat user interface.
- Long conversations are a bit slow (we need to flesh out pagination).
- Let‚Äôs rename ‚ÄúStaff‚Äù to ‚ÄúCourse Staff‚Äù. (We also considered ‚ÄúProfessor/Teaching Assistants‚Äù.)
- Let‚Äôs add more ‚ÑπÔ∏ès to explain ‚ÄúSelected People‚Äù & ‚ÄúCourse Staff‚Äù.
- Let‚Äôs make tutorials to teach people Courselore in detail.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-10-02</summary>

- Issues we fixed:
  - Double submission in Chrome.
  - Server restarting.
  - Firefox not connecting to server.
  - Performance related to priority of Live-Updates.
- Investigated HTTP/3.
- Updated Caddy, Node.js, and dependencies.
- We‚Äôre double the size as last semester.
- Relax offline alerts.
- Show who‚Äôs typing, but hide students from other students.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-09-17</summary>

- Small quality-of-life improvements:
  - Show who liked a message.
  - Reduce the delay between sending a message & triggering its email notifications.
- Security issues:
  - Closing user sessions on the server (we had to sign everyone out just in case‚Ä¶).
  - Cookies & subdomains (it was breaking `try.courselore.org` and could lead to cookie tossing).
  - CSRF (`csurf` was deprecated).
- Investigated double-submit issue.
- Chrome on Android is still crashing 2 times out of 5.
- Filter by Selected People should allow to choose **which** people.
- Some operations are slow because live-updates are putting you behind in the queue.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-09-10</summary>

- No-reply: Let‚Äôs keep the administrator email for now, and at some point implement the feature in which you‚Äôre able to post a message by replying to the email notification.
- Don‚Äôt notify about messages you saw in real-time. Particularly on chats, in which there are many messages in succession.
- Edge case: While messages may be anonymous, the participation of a student in the conversation isn‚Äôt anonymous, so if there are only two students and one posts anonymously, the other can figure out who it was. But we‚Äôre considering that okay.
- Investigating a double-submit issue that Ali & Earl ran into. Don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs causing it yet.
- Locking down the application for people who haven‚Äôt verified their email address seems to have worked üòÅ
- Fixed security & privacy issues:
  - Redirects could lead you outside the application.
  - Students could see who viewed a message, if they knew which URL to query.
- Improved the error messages in the authentication & invitation workflows.
- Show participants on sidebar.
- Let‚Äôs continue allowing you to like your own messages, but let‚Äôs add a way for you to see who liked a message (and let everyone see that).
- Let‚Äôs postpone the notion of deleting users, courses, and so forth. It‚Äôll come particularly handy when we have LMS integration.
- Do something about the case in which a student posts ‚Äúthank you‚Äù in reply to an answer to a question, and the question becoming unresolved: perhaps separate buttons.
- Think about more separation between chats & other types of conversation. Perhaps remove chats for everyone from students?
- Have a setting to configure the delay on email notifications.
- The ceiling for improving performance is high.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-09-03</summary>

- Brought back the concept of ‚ÄúAnnouncements‚Äù.
- Fixed issue with password reset links & Outlook.
- Several quality-of-life features.
- Other topics:
  - A student didn‚Äôt get an email notification for a reply to their question. Could it be because they didn‚Äôt verify their email? (Let‚Äôs lock the system further if you didn‚Äôt verify your email.) Could it be one of the emails didn‚Äôt get relayed, mostly because of wrong domains? Keep an eye out‚Ä¶
  - In the near future, let‚Äôs implement a notion of ‚Äúimporting‚Äù conversations from other courses to allow for reuse, but let‚Äôs **not** put too much structure into the continuity of the courses across semester‚Äîlet‚Äôs let it be more freeform.
  - Get rid of horizontal scrolling. In the content editor toolbar in particular, but in the rest of the application in general as well‚Ä¶

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-08-27</summary>

- Conversation participants deployed.
- Finished things off with Eliot: Polls are mostly fleshed out.
- Password reset issue reported by Ali.
- We started discussing the notion of reusable posts across semesters.
- SAML is a priority for spring, so we should start now, because it will take some time to cut through the red tape.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-08-20</summary>

- DMs: Almost finished, only missing user interface. Most of the work was dealing with how DMs interact with other features, for example, anonymity and email notifications.
- Lock Course (Exam Period): Done. Not merged.
- Polls: Explored the idea of holding the results in the message, but landed on the concept of having polls as external objects, like images.
- Other topics:
  - Administrative interface should show the active courses.
  - Import from Piazza: Announcement messages.
  - Apply filters right away, don‚Äôt have an ‚ÄúApply Filter‚Äù button.
  - **Superpins**, that would be useful for administrative pages with PDFs, zips, and other course material. But let‚Äôs not have a dedicated ‚Äúcourse resources‚Äù feature.
  - Chats should be ‚ÄúSelected People‚Äù by default.
  - On course lock, students may ask private questions.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-08-13</summary>

- Mobile application:
  - Cookies to detect mobile application as opposed to the browser.
  - Redirection flows.
- Digests:
  - Deployed new email notifications infrastructure with delay between receiving a message and sending its notifications.
  - We haven‚Äôt deployed digests because we‚Äôre still dealing with edge cases, for example, what happens when you‚Äôre receiving digests and switch to immediate notifications.
- Participants:
  - Most of the infrastructure is in place. Still dealing with interactions between this feature and other features, for example, search, email notifications, the `@mentions` widget and so forth.
- Polls:
  - They‚Äôre a new type of message content, not something heavyweight like a new type of question. This follows the same lines as Discourse & Slack (where people use reactions (emojis) to do polls).
  - Support multiple answers.
  - Students may see aggregate results.
  - Staff may see individual votes.
  - Allow for closing a poll.
- Zach‚Äôs comments:
  - DMs.
  - SAML (for spring).

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-08-06</summary>

- Mobile application.
  - Select server to connect to (and validate that it‚Äôs a Courselore server).
  - Safe area (notch).
- Email digests.
  - Decorate content from other people‚Äôs perspective.
  - Fixed issues with `#anchors`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-07-30</summary>

- Mobile application is under way: Capacitor is setup, and we‚Äôre working on the page that lets you select the server. We may have issues getting the application approved by Apple.
- Email notification digests are almost done. Also implemented a grace period between sending a message and its email notification, to allow the person to edit.
- The new Tags selector widget is done. The person selector widget for DMs will reuse this work.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-07-23</summary>

- Better email notifications:
  - Filters for conversations in which you participated is now deployed.
  - Emails are threaded.
  - Do we want more granular control for digests, for example, answers to your questions should be received right away?
- Eliot‚Äôs work on the new tags widget isn‚Äôt finished yet.
  - Start investigating mobile application.
- Sketch of 1-to-1 conversations.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-07-16</summary>

- Better ways for administrators to be notified of updates.
- ‚ÄúNew Conversation‚Äù interface changes (sidebar & main form).

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-07-09</summary>

- Administrative interface: Deployed.
- Better email notifications: Deployed (but missing digests).
- Icons: Improving the presentation of ‚ÄúNew Conversation‚Äù form.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-07-02</summary>

- Administrative interface: It‚Äôs almost ready to deploy: We want to revert some changes before we actually deploy.
- Simplified configuration.
- Better email notifications: Doing filtering on database. Everything but digests.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-06-25</summary>

- Better email notifications:
  - Completed the settings page.
  - Implemented the filtering rules.
  - Not actually creating digests yet.
- Administrative interface:
  - Preparing for deployment of initial features:
    - Users with system role management
    - Settings for restricting who can create courses
    - General settings like administrative email
  - Migration process: Setup some tricky database migrations requiring user input for migration of existing installations.
- Other minor things:
  - Fixed layout glitch on user settings profile page when the person doesn‚Äôt have an avatar yet.
- When we get to 1-to-1 conversations, do whispers, similar to Discourse.
- API
- Gamification
  - Badges (for example, first to answer a question)
  - Karma points for whole class and unlock achievements for everyone

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-06-18</summary>

- Administrative interface:
  - Course creation is restricted to only certain users, respecting option set by administrator.
  - List of all users in the system.
- Better email notifications:
  - See interface.
- Smaller things:
  - Fixed configuration issues that made development on Windows not work.
  - Fixed small annoyance in which a tap on user partial would open the tooltip right away on mobile, not respecting the delay.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-06-11</summary>

- Started work on the administrative interface.
- Added an image reverse proxy to serve hotlinked images in message content. This fixes mixed content errors and improves on privacy.
- Several small quality-of-life improvements, for example, including the course name on the ‚ÄúFrom‚Äù field in emails, making it easier for staff to make a note generate a notification, and so forth.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-05-28</summary>

- Had a meeting with Zach: how the first semester with Courselore went; what to do for next semester; and a brief technical overview.
- Implemented the course archival feature.
- A couple more tweaks to the layout of the sidebar.
- Fixed issues: Images in email notifications not showing up on some email clients; close the `@mentions` and `#references` widget on `@‚ê£`; and so forth.
- Minimal integration with Learning Management Systems is a high priority. (Identity only; don‚Äôt do grades and other things right now.)

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-05-24 (Zach)</summary>

- Liked Courselore this first semester and plan on using again next semester (starting things off in August), with a co-instructor who used to use <https://edstem.org>.
- Ran into some bugs that have already been fixed on the latest version.
- Caddy could silence logs **after** a successful startup.
- Most wanted features for next semester:
  - 1-to-1 conversations.
  - SAML (only for authentication; authorization and the invitation process should remain the same).
- Desktop version would be more useful than mobile.
- On the technical side of things:
  - Our live-navigation & live-updates are related to functional reactive programming.
  - Elm gives some of the same benefits, but at the cost of making the programmer work to maintain some of the invariants necessary to make the system work.
  - `key=""` implies uniqueness & perhaps it would be nicer to have more structure in the key besides just a string.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-05-21</summary>

- Sidebar redesign.
  - Ask a question.
  - Quick filters. (Unread isn‚Äôt working yet.)
  - Search takes less space.
  - Filtering by unresolved questions becomes more obvious.
  - The search & filters part of the sidebar stays fixed.
- Made emails copyable.
- Query parameters management, from blocklist to allowlist.
- Questions:
  - Is the semester over? May I downsize the machine? May I deploy new versions with design changes?
    - Yes, the semester is over.
  - Course archival.
    - Prioritize it.
- Review again other applications like Piazza so that we‚Äôre aware of features that people will probably ask us about.
- Our API should enable us to connect with other applications, for example, assignment management, and course material.
  - Though we won‚Äôt necessarily be going to those areas right away.
  - It‚Äôs part of our short-term strategy.
- Roadmap: 20 users by fall, 200 by spring, paid by 2024, profit by 2026
- SAML is a must-have feature for next semester (along with API)
- Administrative interface is for system administrators, not for department administrators(!)
  - It‚Äôs like a root user on Linux.
  - Allowlist people who can create a course.
  - Have complete access to course information.
  - Have one single layer of abstraction: Institution (it encapsulates departments, universities, and so forth).

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-05-14</summary>

- Quicker feedback to actions, for example, sending a message.
  - Investigated how Discord does latency compensation.
  - Disabled submit buttons.
  - Added a ‚Äúwait‚Äù cursor.
  - Latency compensation for sending a message with a placeholder.
- On `/conversations/new`, added support for pre-filling the `<input>`s with query parameters, which is useful for templates & drafts.
- Started implementing conversations drafts.
  - Do we want to show them on the sidebar?
  - Do we want to make them searchable?
- Fixes:
  - Fixed validation error in which a live-update would preserve the `value` of `input` even when it shouldn‚Äôt, for example, to set a question as ‚Äúresolved.‚Äù
  - Fixed uses of `.findLast()`, which isn‚Äôt supported on all browsers yet.
  - Investigated performance issue, which seemed to be have been a temporary issue that solved itself‚Ä¶

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-04-30</summary>

- Day off (holiday).
- Backlog grooming.
- Interface improvements:
  - Tooltips on relative times now target whole phrase.
  - ‚ÄúConversations‚Äù button on mobile now adds entry to history.
  - `theme-color` in Safari.
- Security:
  - Headers, cross-origin, and so forth.
  - Cleaning `localStorage` on sign-out.
- Other:
  - End of the term in two weeks.
  - <https://campus.org>
  - Vacation.
  - Some protocol to interoperate with other tools, including grading systems and live lecture systems.
    - Perhaps don‚Äôt use LTI if it‚Äôs too heavy and bureaucratic.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-04-23</summary>

- Finished and deployed live-updates with new mechanism that‚Äôs resilient to disconnections of any kind, and that doesn‚Äôt require extra round trips to the server.

---

- Improve experience on phone:
  - Make the ‚ÄúConversations‚Äù button push an entry into the history. (We can do that by turning it into a link that points at `/courses/<courseReference>`.)
  - Have a hamburger menu that doesn‚Äôt cover the whole pane underneath, and in that case don‚Äôt push an entry into the history.
  - When you click on the existing ‚ÄúConversations‚Äù menu, it take a little while to respond. But not all the time, so keep an eye out for it. (Maybe it has to do with live-updates coming in and morphing happening on the background?)
- Other ideas for improving the design:
  - Conversations are sorted by most recent activity, but that means when you send a message, the conversation moves to the top, which can be disorienting.
    - Wait for a little while, 10~30 minutes, before sorting.
  - Separate the conversations in sections: One section for conversations with unread messages.
  - Add filters for conversations with unread messages.
  - Quick filters:
    - Staff:
      - Unresolved questions
      - Conversations with unread messages
    - Students:
      - Questions
      - Conversations with unread messages
- Don‚Äôt deploy big design changes in the next two weeks, because we‚Äôre approaching the end of the semester and big design changes could confuse people.
- Over the summer, start thinking more strategically.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-04-09</summary>

- Finished and deployed details on morphing, live navigation, and live updates. This should address several glitches in the application, and give it a more app-like feel.
- We‚Äôll do videos for educators and students with a brief sales pitch, and a tutorial.
- The new contributor who‚Äôll be joining us for the summer may be working on the administrative panel.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-04-02</summary>

- Converted from morphdom into own implementation, which minimizes changes to the DOM, fixing glitches with tooltips, scrolling, and so forth.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-03-20</summary>

- We finished and deployed many performance improvements, including live navigation and live updates powered by live navigation.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-03-12</summary>

- Almost finished live navigation, which speeds things up and makes some pagination details more straightforward to implement.

---

- ETags don‚Äôt seem to be enough: A deployment to try.courselore.org was serving stale assets.
- Our goal is to get new features while we have active users, to have them test things. Goals for the next two months:
  - Finish performance & pagination work.
  - Redesign sidebar, chat messages, and things like announcements vs notes-that-generate-notifications.
  - Notification digests.
  - 1-on-1 conversations.
- Tip sheet on how to get notifications
- After the fall semester, spread the word.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-03-05</summary>

- Deployed a new version with some optimizations (for example, Caddy serving static files), but still not `liveNavigation` and pagination.
- Broke the codebase into multiple files.
- Made `eventSource` more robust: It‚Äôll try to reconnect no matter what happens.

---

  - Look & feel, and speed.
  - Difficulty tracking what‚Äôs going on.
  - Maybe get an specialist in user-interface design after the next iteration.
  - Alternating 10 background colors.

<summary>2021-08-07</summary>

- Styling and user interface.
- Custom validation errors:
  - Because the browser validations have some issues and we want more control over them. Examples:
    - The validation of `type="email"` accepts `example@example` (which is technically correct, but practically incorrect).
    - The validation of `required` accepts empty spaces (again, technically correct, but practically incorrect).
  - Because we want to show error messages in a style that‚Äôs consistent with the rest of the application, and in our own language, as opposed to the different browsers messages.
  - Because we want to apply validations to elements that the Constraint validation API doesn‚Äôt support, for example, `<button type="button">`.
- Categories.
- Did a brief research on the space of email senders; played with the SendGrid API.

<details>
<summary>2021-06-05</summary>

- Progress:
  - Continued the make-over with the new design system. Did the home page, brought back Dark Mode support, did the sign in / sign up workflow, including the Demonstration Inbox, created almost all the components we‚Äôll need (tooltips, dropdowns, modals, and so forth), added support for `prefers-reduced-motion`, and so forth.
- Next week:
  - Finish the redesign with the new design system.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2021-05-29</summary>

- Progress:
  - Finish almost every screen using Bootstrap.
  - Wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the result: Either we‚Äôd end up with a stock-Bootstrap looking application, or the customization would amount to as much work as doing more things from scratch. But the result would be even worse, because people would have to know CSS **as well as Bootstrap**.
  - Started a make-over with a design system lifted from Tailwind. Borrowing only a couple helpers for things like tooltip positioning and modals.
- Next week:
  - Continue the redesign with the new design system.

<summary>2021-05-15</summary>

- Progress:
  - Started a user-interface overhaul: Responsive design, accessibility, fancier components for a bit of a ‚Äúwow factor‚Äù, and so forth.
  - Started using Bootstrap. Not Tailwind because Bootstrap has components, as opposed to just utilities. We‚Äôre continuing to use @leafac/css instead of utilities. We aren‚Äôt using many things from Bootstrap, for example, the grid system, because CSS Grid is better for our case.
- Next week:
  - Finish the following screens: Threads, course settings, and invitations.
  - Return to posts tags.

  - Invitation links can be created and modified (almost‚Äîthe backend for that isn‚Äôt working yet). Also, the invitation links don‚Äôt work yet.
  - DRYed up queries: Most of them happen in a single location and are reused throughout the request. Extracted data types (TypeScript) to clean up the code base.
  - Worked on styles & form validation: Datetime fields; form elements like radio and checkboxes; avoid zooming in on text fields in iOS; use SVG to draw icons & things like the circle that indicate the course accent color; and so forth.

  - Fix name on posts.
  - Finish invitations!!
  - Editing threads and posts.
  - Update threads when other people post.
  - Focus on forum features like **tags** (both on threads and on the posts), upvotes & notifications.

- Finish the account creation workflow and wired it to the authentication workflow demonstrated last week.
- Tried to use [ECMAScript modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) (because of top-level async/await). Still too fresh. While Node‚Äôs support for them isn‚Äôt experimental anymore, some of the underlying infrastructure still is, so other tools in the ecosystem (for example, Jest & ts-node-dev) don‚Äôt support them very well (require flags and whatnot).
- Had issues with some native modules (for example, sharp) not working with @leafac/pkg. Ended up creating <https://npm.im/caxa>.
- Had issues with types for <https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-async-handler>. Ended up creating <https://npm.im/@leafac/express-async-handler>.
- Created a proper **demonstration** mode for CourseLore.

- Wrote documentation at https://github.com/courselore/courselore and these documents you‚Äôre looking at.

- Last week Dr. Scott asked what are the operating system dependencies to run the `courselore` executable (which is generated with @leafac/pkg). To answer this, I tested putting the binary in a Docker container created from [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch); that didn‚Äôt work. Then I tried [alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine); that didn‚Äôt work either! Then I tried [ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/); that worked (naturally, since we‚Äôre running Ubuntu in production & on GitHub Actions). So, as it turns out, not only does the `courselore` executable need some support from the operating system, but it seems like lightweight things like musl libc may not be enough. I‚Äôll take that‚Ä¶

**Progress Report**

- The text processor for posts is done. It supports Markdown, LaTeX, and syntax highlighting. Also, it‚Äôs secure against Cross-Side Scripting (XSS) attacks. [Here‚Äôs some input that exercises all these features](https://github.com/courselore/courselore/raw/e01f05f87039326fba47abab24c78a754a4ff7a8/misc/text-processor-example.md).

- Setup the infrastructure for GitHub Actions:

  - Run the test suite on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
  - Create binaries for all these operating systems.
  - Distribute the binaries as [releases](https://github.com/courselore/courselore/releases/) and as [nightly builds](https://github.com/courselore/courselore/actions/runs/537293785) (GitHub Actions Artifacts)

- Released the following packages:

  - <https://npm.im/courselore>: If people already have Node.js installed, they may try CourseLore with `npx courselore`. Also, they may `npm install courselore` to mount CourseLore as part of a bigger Node.js application. That isn‚Äôt the preferred deployment strategy (using the binaries is), but it‚Äôs a possibility for advanced users.

  - <https://npm.im/@leafac/rehype-shiki>: Rehype is part of the text processor, and Shiki is a syntax highlighter based on Visual Studio Code‚Äôs syntax highlighter. <https://npm.im/@leafac/rehype-shiki> is a package that connects the two and improves on the existing <https://npm.im/rehype-shiki> with support for the latest Shiki version, some architectural differences that decouples the dependencies a little better, and brings TypeScript support.

  - <https://npm.im/@leafac/html>: A safe and convenient way to use JavaScript‚Äôs tagged template literals as an HTML template engine.

  - <https://npm.im/@leafac/pkg>: Fixes some problems with <https://npm.im/pkg>, particularly in how it manages native modules.

**Design Decisions**

- The course URLs may be:

  - **In a flat namespace or in a hierarchical namespace.** A flat namespace is like Reddit‚Äôs `/r/<name>`, and a hierarchical namespace is like GitHub‚Äôs `/<user-or-organization>/<repository>`.

    - A flat namespace is good because it‚Äôs simpler, particularly in self-hosted installations for a single user (think of how silly `courselore.leafac.com/leafac/<course>` looks).

    - A flat namespace is bad because it clashes easily (think of multiple teaching a course identified as `cs-101`).

    - A hierarchical namespace makes sense when there‚Äôs the notion of **organizations**, which could be a group of people who have several courses together. That case probably is rare.

  - **Given by the user, or generated by the system.** An URL given by the user is like Reddit‚Äôs and GitHub‚Äôs URLs (for example `github.com/leafac/<repository>`). An URL generated by the system is like YouTube (for example, `youtu.be/<random-string-that-is-the-video-identifier>)`.

    - An URL given by the user is simpler to share (think of an URL projected on the board in a classroom).

    - URLs given by the user are more complex for the system, because we have to handle renames, redirects, and so forth.

  - **We decided to go with a flat namespace and system-generated URLs.** For example, `courselore.org/fjdkwoer83`. Because URLs are generated by the system, we don‚Äôt see a need for a subpath like `/r/<something>`. We know not to generate identifiers that would clash with routes we‚Äôd want to use, for example `/settings`. We may want to have some sort of aliasing in the future so users can create their own readable URLs if they want.

  - **References:**

    - Piazza has alises like `piazza.com/jhu/fall2020/en601329/home`.
    - Campuswire uses the Reddit approach with URLs like `campuswire.com/c/G9E051068/feed`.
    - They have different URLs for joining a course and then later for visiting it. We don‚Äôt want that.
    - <https://www.acadly.com/> only has the **magic link** approach.
    - <https://superauth.com>: A technology to handle authentication.

- Authentication methods:

  - The options are:

    1. A plain username/password authentication strategy.
    2. A **magic link** approach like Slack.
    3. Single sign-on integrated with universities‚Äô systems.

  - We‚Äôre going with Option 2 for now, as it seems like a good sweet-spot in terms of security, simplicity to implement, and generality. It works for every university without extra effort on our part. That said, we may still give Option 1 as an alternative (as Slack does). Also, people may customize CourseLore with their own routes to implement Option 3.

  - **Note:** We‚Äôre following Slack in the approach to authentication (the so-called **magic link**), but we‚Äôre **not** going to have the weird separation of accounts per team that Slack has. There will only be one CourseLore account per email and the user may join multiple courses.
