Tests:
macOS
npx
package.json doesn’t exist
package.json exists
package.json specifies caddy version
running from subdirectory
running with --prefix

Windows
npx
package.json doesn’t exist
package.json exists
package.json specifies caddy version
running from subdirectory
running with --prefix



Inspired by https://github.com/RecuencoJones/caddy-npm, but supports any version of Caddy.
